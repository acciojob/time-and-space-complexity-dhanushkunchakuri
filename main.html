	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is an important measure of how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the number of operations it performs as the input size grows. An efficient algorithm typically has lower time complexity, making it faster and more scalable for larger datasets.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs relative to the input size. An algorithm with a Space Complexity of O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
